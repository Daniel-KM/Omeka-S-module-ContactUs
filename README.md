Contact us (module for Omeka S)
===============================

[Contact us] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to add a site page block with
a "Contact us" form.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename module folder `ContactUs`. Then install it like any
other Omeka module and follow the config instructions.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module].


Quick start
-----------

Create a site page and add the block "Contact us".

By default, the email is the site admin one.
The simple antispam is a simple list of questions and answers for the visitor.

The block is themable: copy the file `common/block-layout/contact-us.phtml` in
your theme.

When submitted, the site admin will receive the email, and a confirmation email
will be sent to the visitor.

If you want to use the "Contact us" page in all your sites, you can use the
module [Next], that has a special block to duplicate a page in multiple places.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page on GitHub.
