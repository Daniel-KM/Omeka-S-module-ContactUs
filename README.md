Contact Us (module for Omeka S)
===============================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Contact Us] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to add a site page block with
a "Contact us" form. The messages are sent by email to the admin and can be read
directly in the interface too. The form can be set on a resource page too, and
in that case, it is possible for the admin to send a zip of the medias.

Furthermore, it is possible to send a email to the author of a resource, for
example for an institutional repository of student works.

The form is fully available by api, so it can be used by a third party client,
like any web or phone app.

The module is compatible with module [Selection], that allows to store a list of
resources.

A block allows to display a form to subscribe to a newsletter too.


Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

The module [Common] must be installed first.

If you use an old theme, you can install [Blocks Disposition] too.

You may use the release zip to install it or clone the source via git.

* From the zip

Download the last release [ContactUs.zip] from the list of releases (the master
does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `ContactUs`.

```sh
cd modules
git clone https://gitlab.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-ContactUs ContactUs
```

Then install it like any other Omeka module and follow the config instructions.


Quick start
-----------

The module adds two blocks for site pages: Contact Us and Newsletter.

The blocks can be placed anywhere in the site.

### Config

Fill the options in the main settings, the site settings and the page block.

For subjects and messages, you can use placeholders for customization. They
should be wrapped with `{` and `}`: "from", "email", "name", "site_title",
"site_url", "subject", "message", "ip", "newsletter". When there is a resource,
you can use too "resource_id", "resource_title", "resource_url", and any
property term, like "dcterms:date". Note that the property should exist in all
cases, else it won't be filled.

### Static pages

Create a site page and add the block "Contact us".

The simple antispam is a simple list of questions and answers for the visitor.

The block is themable: copy the file `common/block-layout/contact-us.phtml` in
your theme.

When submitted, the site admin will receive the email, and a confirmation email
will be sent to the visitor.

If you want to use the "Contact us" page in all your sites, you can use the
module [Block Plus], that has a special block to duplicate a page in multiple places.

### Resource pages

The form is displayed automatically on item set, item or media show pages and
item browse page. The settings can be set for each site.

To manage the display more precisely, use the module [Blocks Disposition], or
add the following code in your theme:

```php
// For a single resource.
echo $this->contactUs(['resource' => $resource]);
// For multiple resources.
echo $this->contactUs();
```

The partial is themable: copy the file `common/contact-us.phtml` in your theme.

### Admin interface

The contact us list of message is available in the left sidebar and can be
managed: mark read, set spam, delete.

### Multicheckbox in item/browse, search results or selection

To send contact message with selected items, add the form as above and add a
checkbox aside each result in the theme template, for example in "item/browse.phtml"
or "search/resource-list.phtml":

```php
<input form="contact-us" class="contact-us-resource" type="checkbox" name="fields[id][]" value="<?= $resource->id() ?>" title="<?= $this->translate('Add this resource to the message to send') ?>"/>
```

To be automatically managed, the name of the input should be `fields[id][]` for
now. If you use `resource_ids[]`, it is automatically managed via js. Don't
forget to set the attribute `form="contact-us"`, or use some js to set it before
submission.


Development
-----------

### Testing

Install Omeka with dev dependencies first.

```sh
# From module directory.
composer install
../../vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox --configuration /var/www/html/modules/ContactUs/test/phpunit.xml
```

### Api

Any user can create a message:
```sh
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -i 'https://example.org/api/contact_messages?key_identity=xxx&key_credential=yyy&pretty_print=1' --data '{"o:email":"alpha@beta.com","o-module-contact:body":"message"}'
```

Or with a file (via a form):
```sh
curl -X POST -H 'Accept: application/json' -i 'https://example.org/api/contact_messages?pretty_print=1' -F 'data={"o:email":"alpha@beta.com","o-module-contact:body":"message"}' -F 'file[0]=@/home/user/my-file.jpeg'
```

Or with a base64-encoded file inside the json payload:
```sh
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -i 'https://example.org/api/contact_messages?key_identity=xxx&key_credential=yyy&pretty_print=1' --data '{"o:email":"alpha@beta.com","o-module-contact:body":"message","file":[{"name":"filename.txt","base64":"T21la2EgUw=="}]}'
```

Available keys are:
- `o:owner`: generally useless, because the user is already authenticated.
- `o:email`: required for anonymous people.
- `o:name`
- `o-module-contact:subject`: recommended.
- `o-module-contact:body`: required message.
- `o-module-contact:newsletter`: true or false.
- `file`: only one file is currently managed. Useless when the file is sent via
  a posted form.

The owner or the email is useless when the user is already authenticated and is
skipped in that case, except if the user has the right to change the owner of a
message.


TODO
----

- [ ] Fix consent label.
